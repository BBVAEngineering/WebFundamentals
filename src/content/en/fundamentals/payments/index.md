## Introduction

W3C Payment APIs is an emerging web standard being developed by the W3C to simplify online payments 
and enable a broader set of players to participate easily in the payments ecosystem on the web. 
The standards are flexible; they work with various types of payment systems and are not tied to 
any specific browser, payment method, or payment service provider. This flexibility enables 
development simplicity, deployment consistency, and future compatibility with emerging payment 
technologies.

Benefits of W3C Payment APIs:

**For consumers**, they simplify checkout flow, by making it a few taps instead of typing small 
characters many times on a virtual keyboard.

**For merchants**, they make it easier to implement with a variety of payment options already 
filtered for the customer.

**For payment handlers**, they allow bringing any type of payment methods to the web with 
relatively easy integration.

**For payment service providers**, they bring new payment methods and enhance the ability of 
businesses to serve more customers with a better developer experience and more secure solutions.

    <h3>Standard and Open</h3>
    W3C Payment APIs are an open payment standard for the web platform for the first time
    in history. They are available for any players to implement.</div>

    <h3>Easy and Consistent</h3>
    W3C Payment APIs make checkout easy for the user, by reusing stored 
payments and address information and removing the need for the user to fill in checkout forms. 
Since the UI is implemented by the browser natively, users see a familiar and consistent checkout 
experience on any website that implements the standard.</div>
